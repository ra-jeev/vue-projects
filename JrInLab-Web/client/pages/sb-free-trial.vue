              We're a passionate group of coders, educators &mdash; and parents.
              We believe that teaching & handling kids is not a part time job,
              and that is why all of us are fulltime educators here.
              <br />
              <br />
              We have spent a lot of time designing a curriculum which is age
              appropriate. It follows an activity based approach, and emphasizes
              on experiential learning.

Kids combine different blocks, like Lego, to create logic.\n- On the other hand, Python is a text based programing language where the kids will need to type out the whole code themselves. Python is used everywhere in the real world.\n- Scratch is suitable for all ages, specially for younger kids, while teens can opt for Python.',

You also get to see and understand our teaching methodology.\n- It also gives you an opportunity to interact with the teacher and get your questions answered. We specifically reserve 10 minutes of the trial class for this purpose.\n- Your child will be doing a hands on coding activity following the teacher's instructions.

          question: `Can my child join the class using a mobile?`,
