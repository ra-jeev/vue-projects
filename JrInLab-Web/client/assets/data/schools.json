      "description": "JrInLab's \"Tech Clubs\" aim to supplement schools, in their quest to provide quality technical education to their students.\n\nHiring and retaining good technical educators for smaller, and independent schools is very difficult, more so, if you're in a non-metro city or town. At the same time, the technical field is quite vast, and ever changing, so it is not possible for a single faculty to keep pace with this rapid change.\n\nWe, at JrInLab, aim to change this through the concept of tech clubs. Tech club gives your school access to:\n- Experts in various technical fields\n- Up-to-date & frequently refreshed quality curriculum\n- A channel for your students to collaborate and learn from each other"
